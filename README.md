## STEPPER MOTOR CONTROLLER

Stepper motor controller using the eleksmana SE board.
There are two versions of the project:

- [Vs_1](https://github.com/DiegoGiFo/Stepper/tree/master/Vs_1): implemented with the library AccelStepper.
This version doesn't work properly cause I nedd to understand better the usage of the library.

- [Vs_2](https://github.com/DiegoGiFo/Stepper/tree/master/Vs_2): implemented with the library StepperDriver.
This is the working version.
